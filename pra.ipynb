It is also some-\\ntimes characterized by a feeling of choking, suffocation,\\nor crushing heaviness. This condition is also called angi-\\nna pectoris.\\nDescription\\nOften described as a muscle spasm and choking sen-\\nsation, the term “angina” is used primarily to describe\\nchest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygen\\nto the heart muscle. An episode of angina is not an actual\\nheart attack, but rather pain that results from the heart\\nmuscle temporarily receiving too little blood. This tem-\\nporary condition may be the result of demanding activi-\\nties such as exercise and does not necessarily indicate\\nthat the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage.\\nIn fact, episodes of angina seldom cause permanent dam-'), Document(id='1422b4df-4f06-4c67-bff2-54f96824f111', metadata={'source': 'Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 208}, page_content='nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration or\\nintensity to cause an actual heart attack.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAngina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi-\\nness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone (ster-\\nnum). It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder, arm,\\nneck, or jaw regions. Because episodes of angina occur\\nwhen the heart’s need for oxygen increases beyond the\\noxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart, the\\ncondition is often precipitated by physical exertion. In\\nmost cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few min-\\nutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medica-\\ntions. Emotional stress, extreme temperatures, heavy\\nmeals, cigarette smoking, and alcohol can also cause or\\ncontribute to an episode of angina.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians can usually diagnose angina based on the\\npatient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev-\\ner, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm or\\nrule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under-\\nlying heart disease.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\\nAn electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical\\nimpulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electrical\\nactivity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioning\\nproperly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio-\\ngrams are also useful in investigating other possible\\nabnormal features of the heart.\\nStress test\\nFor many individuals with angina, the results of an\\nelectrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor-')]\n",
